		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we implemented a simple simulation by approximating surfaces as a combination of point masses and springs with Verlet Integration. To increase the realism of the simulation, we incorporated object collision, self-collision, and maximum spring lengths. We finally implemented some shaders for diffusion shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, bump/displacement shading, and environment shading. I personally found the simplification/approximation of surfaces and meshes as point masses and springs to be surprisingly effective and interesting.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<b>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?</b>
		<br>
		A higher ks implies that the spring between the point masses is stronger, which leads to the cloth not hanging as low, relative to the cloth when the ks is lower. Consequently, the cloths with higher ks bounces around less as the spring keeps the cloth moving in 1 fluid motion, while in the lower ks, other factors - primarily gravity is able to have a large effect on the motion of the cloth. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>What about for density?</b>
		<br>
		Lower density implies that each point mass has less weight, which means that each point is not able to pull on its neighbors as much. This leads to lower density acting more “fluidly”, where most of the point travel in the same direction for the majority of the time before rest. Where as with a larger density, each point mass can move more independently, causing interesting wave shapes as the cloth settles. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>What about for damping?</b>
		<br>
		A larger damping coefficient leads to less time taken to settle, as the amount of energy lost each step, meaning that it will settle quicker. In particular, if you set the damping to 0%, then the simulation “never”(I only ran it for 5 or so minutes) ends. Lower damping also has each individual point acting more on its own - particularly at the start - as it takes longer for the gravity to become the primary force acting on each point. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.
</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state! If you choose to use different parameters than the default ones, please list them.</b>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<b>Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.</b>
		<br>
		For both the sphere and plane collision, we loop through each point mass and ensure that it is not colliding with the respective object. In the case of spheres, determining collision is straightforward, as it is just the distance between the point and the center of the sphere relative to the radius. If the distance between the point and center is less than the radius, then there is a collision. To ensure that the cloth does not clip through the sphere, we must at the point move the point mass’s position such that it is outside of the sphere. We do this by adding the “rest” of the vector, which points to the tangent point on the surface of the sphere and then multiplying the “rest” of the vector by (1-friction) to account for the friction between the cloth and the sphere. This correctly gives us the position of the point mass had it properly collided with the sphere. For the plane collision detection, the math is slightly more interesting, where we check to see if the ‘side’ of the point has changed since the last step. We calculate this by taking the dot product with the norm and comparing the signs between the two. If the signs are different, then we must move the point to the “tangent point” plus some offset, where the tangent point is the intersection point between the plane and the movement of the point. Finally we once again scale this vector by (1-friction) to account for the friction between the point mass and the plane. 

		As mentioned above, the higher spring constant means that the spring is less likely to bend/move. This can be seen in the images with the varying spring constants, where the higher the spring constant the less the cloth “forms” around the ball, but rather, it retains its plane like shape more. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.</b>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.</b>	
		We run the ‘self_collide’ method on each point after calculating the net force and the corresponding verlet integration for position. Each point is then placed into a new vector based on its hashcode(a function of its x, y, z coordinates), and then compared to those for collision. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm significantly from O(n^2), where we compare each point to every other point. Each time self_collide is called, we check through every other point at the same hash index(assuming the hash results in a non-nullptr), where we first check that we don’t consider collision on the same point. Then, we calculate the distance between each ‘candidate point’ and the original point, and if it is less than 2 * thickness, that means that the points are too close and should have collided. If the points are too close, then we calculate the correction vector, which is the unit vector of the vector between the two points, multiplied 2 * thickness minus the distance. For each point, we sum up all the correction vectors and keep a count. After looping through all of the candidate points, if the number of corrections is non-zero, we then add the correction vector divided by the number of corrections divided by the number of simulation steps. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</b>

		<b>Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<b>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</b>

		<b>Show a screenshot of your texture mapping shader using your own custom texture by modifying the textures in /textures/.</b>

		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that’s not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh’s coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.</b>
